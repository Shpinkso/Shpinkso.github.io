Get back to working on them!However, due to a concept called the &#8220;theory of constraints&#8221; (see &#8220;The Goal&#8221; by E.M. Goldratt) this is actually a terribly inefficient way of getting value through your business.<br><br>I&#8217;m going to approach this slightly differently to Goldratt, so let&#8217;s start with these premises<br><strong>1) Development of a product\/service goes through several sequential steps <\/strong><br>Yes, even if we&#8217;re super agile we do still find ourselves going through sequential steps, e.g. defining what we want, identifying what it depends on, actually doing it, getting reviews &amp; presumably smashing a big green release button.<br><strong>2) Work in progress costs effort<\/strong><br>Someone has to estimate, design, do something with it, otherwise it&#8217;s not really in progress<br><strong>3) Unfinished work goes stale over time and costs effort to un-stale-ify<\/strong><br>Un-stale-ify &#8230;. you&#8217;re welcome! Pretty much any work that isn&#8217;t completely implemented and on test will get out of date enough to be not worth having.<br><br>Based on these, I think we can build the case the case for the importance of bottlenecks. <br>Starting with 1, lets assume that we have an overly simplistic sequence A-B-C.<br>A is super efficient and puts 10 units through per day<br>B is not too bad with 9 units per day<br>C is our bottleneck with just 4 units per day<br><br>It seems fairly obvious that if we get A and B to work at full capacity then we still don&#8217;t make any more than 4 units per day that we can sell. A and B are consuming cost and produce surplus that starts to pile up, rust, and everyone is blaming poor C.<br>So, ok, that was obvious and we decide to recruit a second C, now we&#8217;re a bit closer and managing 8 units per day&#8230; we still have that surplus though and that hurts (see premise 2 and 3).<br>A is still making 10 units per day<br>B is still making 9 units per day<br>C is now 8 units per day<br><br>Getting A and B to work at full capacity doesn&#8217;t help. Throughput will never be higher than 8 &amp; we&#8217;ll end up with a big rusting backlogs behind B and C. This &#8216;rusting&#8217; occurs over time, the longer the thing sits around, the more effort it costs.<br>Ultimately there is no benefit to optimising locally at A and B, if C isn&#8217;t going any faster, then the system isn&#8217;t going any faster.<br>Bottlenecks are everything because any optimisation anywhere apart from the bottleneck is only going to cost you more and gain you nothing &#8211; even slow you down!<br>What if we took a different approach? A &#8216;Pull&#8217; rather than &#8216;Push&#8217; approach.Let&#8217;s give each step a fixed backlog of up to C&#8217;s maximum capacity and no more. The previous step only feeds in enough to fill the backlog if there&#8217;s space.This means that A and B start realising that they sometimes don&#8217;t need to work at full capacity and the same end product quantities get generated regardless, while also not causing overflowing backlogs.<br>Applying this idea to knowledge work like software development, there&#8217;s even more benefit &#8211; as this &#8216;spare&#8217; time can be used for learning, personal development, to look at what *should* be done as well as what *must* be done, maybe help the bottleneck out or (and this is really important) investigate new and creative ideas to give your business an edge.<br>Suffering with bottlenecks?
